# Custom-Compiler

This is a interpreter (soon to be compiler) that interprets my own language [Sarateese]
Sarateese is a language composed of my favorite parts of java, rust, and python!
View the DOCS txt to see examples of Sarateese code.
To run Sarateese, write in a txt document and reference the txt document in the main rust file.
